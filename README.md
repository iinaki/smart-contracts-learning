# Smart Contracts and Blockchain Development - by IÃ±aki Llorens

### 1. [`/HomeHunters`](./HomeHunters)

A real estate NFT DApp. It allows sellers to list properties, buyers to purchase properties using cryptocurrency, and various stakeholders to verify and approve transactions. The app utilizes Solidity for smart contract development, JavaScript (React & Testing) for frontend development, Hardhat as a development framework for smart contracts, and Ethers.js for blockchain interaction.

### 2. [`/lottery`](./lottery)

A lottery DApp. As you might know, there is no possibility to generate random numbers in a smart contract because of how the blockchain works. How can nodes agree on the truthfulness of an app if every node generates a different random number? To solve this problem, I integrated Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) into my smart contract.

### 3. [`/bootcamps`](./bootcamps)

Everything related to the Chainlink Bootcamp 2024, which I took part in, and also stuff that i got from Patrick Collins' Solidity with Foundry 30hs course.
